# Objective

This repo has the objective to keep a log of my progress learning Ruby.

Give up, because all Ruby LSPs are stupid and don't work without sudo.
Why make a LSP that is sudo dependent? `gem` and `bundle` don't work without sudo, so i run mannualy sudo on them, but still both the sorbet and solargraph LSPs keep trying to run `gem` and `bundle`.
